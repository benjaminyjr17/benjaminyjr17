### Critical Features
* Advanced application of Cramer's Rule to solve standard equations for both regression models.
* Comprehensive data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
* Extensive correlation analysis to identify key socioeconomic predictors of mortality.
* Implementation of both multiple and polynomial regression modeling techniques.
* Statistical validation through residual analysis and RÂ² evaluation.

### Results
* Achieved **RÂ² score of 0.5628** for multiple regression model using education and demographic variables.
* Developed a polynomial model capturing non-linear relationships with RÂ² of 0.4157.
* Provided evidence-based policy recommendations for healthcare resource allocation.
