# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben!  

I'm a final-year Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, with double minors in Business and Communication Studies. I combine creativity, curiosity, and programming skills to solve real-world problems. I automate workflows, build machine learning tools, and develop intelligent systems that drive meaningful impact.  

Currently exploring the intersection of **AI**, **finance**, and **systems thinking.**

### Critical Features  
* Advanced applications of Cramer's Rule to solve standard equations for both regression models.  
* Comprehensive data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn libraries.  
* Extensive correlation analysis to identify key socioeconomic predictors of mortality.  
* Implementation of both multiple and polynomial regression modeling techniques.  
* Statistical validation through residual analysis and RÂ² evaluation.  

### Critical Findings  
* Achieved **RÂ² score of 0.5628** for multiple regression model using education and demographic variables.  
* Developed a polynomial model capturing non-linear relationships with **RÂ² score of 0.4157.**  
* Provided evidence-based policy recommendations for healthcare resource allocation.
